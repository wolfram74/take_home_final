two angles of approach
problem 1: fourier decomposition of input data
  consider: detrend with linear fit of boundary conditions
  numerical integral of fourier series
  compare with original data
  plot power spectrum

problem 2: analytic evolution of generic heat line
  Solve 1-D heat diffusion
  make contour plot (or animation?) of 1-D heat diffusion
  determine evolution of distinct wavelengths

problem 3: numerical evolution of input data and comparison
  Execute a dufort frankel evolution
  make use of the time data and analytic solution to judge fitness of simulation
